# x in s... true if element x is in sequence s

# s1 + s2... concatenates two sequences s1 and s2
# s * n, n * s... n copies of sequence s concatenated (linked together)
# s[i]... i-th elements in sequence s
# s[i : j]... slice of sequence s from index i to j-1
# len(s)... length of sequence s, the number of elements in s
# min(s)... the smallest element in sequence s
# max(s)... the largest element in sequence s
# sum(s)... sum of all numbers in sequence s
# for loop... traverse elements from left to right in a for loop
# <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=... compares two sequences
